## Aerospace Engineering Projects

### WARDEN – Mars Mission (RCS System Lead)

As the lead for the Reaction Control System (RCS), I was responsible for designing and validating thruster configurations for a multi-stage spacecraft targeting a Mars transit mission. My work involved calculating torque balances, optimizing thruster orientation, and performing GNC simulations to support precision maneuvering, docking, and abort scenarios. I also contributed to subsystem integration, line routing, and propulsion documentation as part of the Chemical Propulsion and Dynamics team.
