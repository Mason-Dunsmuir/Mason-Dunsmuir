<h1>Hi, I'm Mason Dunsmuir!<br/>
Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Specialist, CAD Modeler</h1>

<h2>Aerospace Engineering Projects (WIP):</h2>

<b>WARDEN – Mars Mission (RCS System Lead)</b><br/>
Led the full Reaction Control System (RCS) design for a Mars-bound, multi-stage spacecraft. Personally responsible for thruster pack configuration, torque balancing, and validation through GNC simulations. Optimized thruster orientation to support orbital maneuvering, docking, and contingency control. Contributed to subsystem integration, line routing, and design documentation as part of the Chemical Propulsion and Dynamics team.<br/>

<h2>About Me</h2>

I’m a senior at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a focus in rocket propulsion and a minor in computational mathematics. I combine hands-on prototyping with system-level simulation. My work spans high-speed testing, spacecraft dynamics, and CAD-to-manufacturing integration.
